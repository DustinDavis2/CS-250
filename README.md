Question: How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

Answer: By asking clarifying questions. What does the program currently do? What does it need to do? What does the polished program look like to you? Then I will go over other end user possibilities, things that can go wrong or could be misunderstood. The "user stories" helps accomplish this by creating a simple, clear cut, "heres what the end result should be, and how to accomplish that", that the developers can easily understand. 

Question: How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Answer: When developing a program I like to first imagine the end concept, then break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks and solve them step by step. I believe its important to also stay open to changes and improvements while working through these tasks. To incorporate Agile, if working on my own, I would incorporate a Kanban board into my development process. If I am working with a team, I would want to prioritize using Scrum methods so we can plan short sprints, track progress daily and visually, and be capable of adapting quickly based on feedback.

Question: What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Answer: For me there are a few things that make a good team member. One of the more important things is good communication, and doing so frequently. Keeping team mates up to date on where you are with your work, any problems you are facing or delays, and any ideas that might help the overall project. Another important thing is taking ownership of not just your work, but the project as a whole. Everyone on the team should look approach the project with ownership, making sure that what needs to get done, gets done. The first priority would be your own delegated work or assignment, but if someone is struggling on an important piece, or is out sick or an accident occured, I feel its important to help out, wherever priorities lie, to ensure completion of tasks during sprints.
